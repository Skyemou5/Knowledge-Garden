# General Self Care

When starting out, try not to overwhelm yourself by doing everything at once



# Skin Care

A few things to keep in mind. Lot's of products out there. Try a lot of things, and see what your skin likes the best.

A basic skincare stack usually involves:

- Cleanser
	- Exfoliating*
- Moisturizer
- Some retinol product
- Cover product


>[!INFO] Retinol, a derivative of vitamin A, is a powerful ingredient in skincare known for its anti-aging and skin-clearing benefits. It works by increasing skin cell turnover, promoting collagen production, and reducing inflammation, which helps to clear acne, reduce fine lines, wrinkles, and improve overall skin texture. However, retinol can also make skin more sensitive to sunlight and cause irritation, such as dryness, redness, and peeling, especially when first starting to use it. It's important to start with a low concentration and gradually increase usage as your skin adapts.


>[!TIP] for retinol or Altreno (I use this one because it's less irritating and might work better) go ask a dermatologist for a prescription. Normal retinol is cheaper, Altreno is more expensive




Here's what I do as of Feb 2024:

- Shower and scrub face with a cleanser and rubber face scrubber

	- ![[notes/attachments/Pasted image 20240206200953.png|300]]
- Altreno every other day. I always apply it before everything else
- Then I suggest going through [The Ordinary](https://theordinary.com/en-us/category/skincare) regemine builder, but I use the following products:

>[!NOTE] With high quality products, this includes shampoos too, you only need a very small amount of the product.

The general guide for order goes like so:
1. **Cleanse**: Start with the Squalane Cleanser to remove makeup and cleanse the skin. 
2. **Altreno** (everyother day, you don't need a lot)
3. **Water-based serums**: Apply the Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate Solution (Vitamin C) to brighten the skin.
4. **More water-based serums**: Follow with the Amino Acids + B5 for hydration and the Matrixyl 10% + HA for anti-aging benefits.
5. **Hydration**: Use Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA to provide immediate hydration.
6. **Eye serum**: Apply the Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG around the eyes to reduce puffiness and dark circles.
7. **Oil**: Finish with the 100% Plant-Derived Squalane to lock in moisture.
8. **Emulsion**: The Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% can be used before the moisturizer if you prefer, as it's an emulsion and could help with oil control and blemishes.
9. **SPF** you'll want to get a high quality SPF, to protect your face UV radiation. There are nice ones made for skin care routines on the face.

10. **Shea Butter** to keep everything on [Organic Shea Butter – Sky Organics](https://skyorganics.com/products/organic-unrefined-shea-butter-8oz)
11. Every few weeks you could do a mud mask to clean out pores. [Amazon.com : Aztec Secret – Indian Healing Clay 1 lb – Deep Pore Cleansing Facial & Body Mask – The Original 100% Natural Calcium Bentonite Clay – New Version 2 : Beauty & Personal Care](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00S7ZPB8Q/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)


>[!IMPORTANT] Remember to pay attention to your body and alter your routine if you need to, and talk to a dermatologist.




# Hair 

Hair can be one of the most difficult things to work with. A few things to keep in mind.

What are your goals and what can you afford?

If you plan on doing laser and/or electrolysis the you want to avoid pulling the hair out because those methods act on the hair follicles. If not, then tweezing and waxing is a nice way to feel smooth for a little bit, though a bit painful.

Laser and electrolysis however take a long time. It's not one and done. You need to continue to do sessions over a long period of time, timed with your hair growth cycles. Over time follicles will die or become dormant. Cycles are different for different parts of the body. For example, for the face it's recommended to go in for laser every 4 weeks, the rest of body is probably alright around 6 week cycles. 

The two places I go:
