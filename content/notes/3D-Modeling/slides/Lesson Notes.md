# Model this
Go Kart Mechanical Brake Caliper
--
- I want to see how well you can do this
## Criteria


- everything a single mesh except for the nuts bolts and screws and other obvious separate pieces
- doesn't have to be perfect, just do your best
	- don't spend too long on this
- you can use kitbashed screws and bolts if you want. Or exclude the screws and bolts
- I will be looking for generally nice topology
