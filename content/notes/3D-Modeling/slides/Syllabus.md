### Course Expectations


**Increase technical skills**
Students will increase their technical skills and knowledge in 3D and be able to solve more complex problems.

**Learn the basics of pipeline**
Students will learn the basics of film pipelines, and some game pipeline. This will help them in working with an end in mind, and aide them in being productive team members.

**Learn file management**
Students will learn the importance of file management. They will learn some useful conventions. This will help them be productive team members and help them be more efficient and productive in their personal projects.

**Expectations**  
Students are expected to work a minimum of six hours a week on their objectives for the course. They are supposed to plan and execute these objectives regularly.

ALL work submitted by the student create work solely by them (except for group projects). Use of any outside work will result in a failing grade.

The course will be broken down into a series of outcomes; each outcome will have some modules that will help the students work through the class. Each module will contain:

Students are expected to participate in the online classes, and pay attention to the teams channel.

### Quizzes and Exams

Students are expected to work. Supposed to be sect-motivated, and to follow through. You are to be creative; you are must be problem-solvers.

### Grading Criteria

Instructors and peers will grade using a rubric provided in course outcomes.

In part — projects will be graded objectively by measurable advancement, without bias or opinion — this will include the technical aspects and concepts of the project and a demonstration of the toolset or software.

Assignments are graded based on completion. Grading is relevant to industry standards, which define the quality of the work submitted as determined by the course instructor. The assessment will include the elements and concepts of design, use of problem-solving skills, and craftsmanship.

There is a high expectation of academic integrity on all course assignments and activities. Plagiarism, cheating, and fabrication or falsification of projects will not be tolerated and will have severe consequences. The penalty for any offense will result in a failing grade for the course, as well as a formal report to the Department Chair and Student Affairs. If you have questions, please read the University's "Student Rights and Responsibilities" policy.

### Attendance

Regular attendance is essential to success in the class. Students can expect the following:

Instructors will take roll. Participation may count toward a quarter of students grade. Students may receive a failing grade if they miss more than three times. Read UVUs policies on attendance for more information

### Policies

Reminder: work must be 100% original, and made by the student for the class. Any other assignments will result in a failing grade.

There is no extra credit offered in this course. Students can resubmit with instructors’ approval or request.

Be sure to always backup your files on a regular basis. Unfinished or lost projects due to data loss, or mismanagement will not be accepted.

It is essential that students understand that university policy dictates ownership of intellectual property developed in the context of a school course. The University owns Such products and not the students, faculty, or staff involved in instruction, coordination, support, and production of these intellectual property assets.

If you, as a student majoring in Digital Media, wish to market your capstone project (or any other title developed while you are a student), there is a process established through UVU’s Office of Technology Commercialization. You must conform to the rules, policies, and process outlined by this university department. Discussions on the part of this process will be in class.

FYI: This is not a policy developed and written here at UVU. This standard is for all educational institutions in the State of Utah, as part of their regional accreditation, which is a component of the national system. In other words, every accredited college or university in the country, public or private, conforms to this policy.
