## Blender Course for UVU



This course is being developed by Clayton Lantz and Ben Shurts at Utah Valley University.

>This website and course is being planned and created using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), A tool for creating knowledge networks, taking notes, and doing all sorts of productivity tasks. This allows us to create a digital garden of knowledge for students to easily access and search through. The graph at the bottom represents the course material and how topics connect to one-another. This lets us and students understand the material and how topics connect at a top level visually at a glance and makes retrieving and finding information when needed significantly easier and faster.
>If you want to use obsidian to view the course content make sure you have safe mode off and the following plugins installed

The aim of this course is to teach the fundamentals of CG by using Blender as the vehicle to learn. The reason for Blender is that it is increasing in popularity, it has a relatively low barrier to entry, and it tries to touch on most of the pieces of CG pipeline.

Students will learn basics of the underlying mathematic principals used in CG, which will help them solve problems later in their CG journeys. They will also learn some of the principles of 3D modeling, rigging, animation, surfacing, shading, lighting, rendering, and compositing.
