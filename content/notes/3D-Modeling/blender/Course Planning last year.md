# Blender Course

## some general ideas on how the course should go

The general mantra of the course will be to learn blender by learning the underlying fundamentals of CG in narrow set across the pipeline so students can gain exposure to the wide set of ideas necessary to be successful. 

In general the blender course should cover a lot of the things that aren't covered throughout the rest of the program and talk about why these things are important.
Some of these things include:

## Lessons and assignments

		- Raster
			- raytraced raster
				- new technology
				- still not as good as pathtracing
