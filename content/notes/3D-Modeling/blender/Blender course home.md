			- tries to be a true as possible to how light works
				- light transport research, physics and computer science have come together to make these renderers possible.

				- how they work
					- lights
					- cameras
					- ray bounces
		- Raster
			- raytraced raster
				- new technology
				- still not as good as pathtracing
			- realism has to be faked
				- many effects like reflection are only calculated in screen space unless reflection maps are used
				- small details often need to be offloaded to normal maps
					- in film workflows much of the small details is allowed to be geometry
		- CG rendering theory
			- things to keep in mind
				- not all render engines are the same
					- actually they are all a little different
				- some settings may be named differently
				- **the underlying theory is the same

				- why do we need to understand them
				- samples per types of rendering
					- reflection

		- render passes
		- cryptomates
		- piecing separate renders together
			- background
			- character
			- VFX
- A few last things
	- audio
		- audio reactive work
		- film work has audio
		- it may be helpful in some cases to keep audio in mind when working.
