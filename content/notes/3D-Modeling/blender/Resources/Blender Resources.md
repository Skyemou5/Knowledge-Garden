For this course we will be using several different tools and resources to complete the lessons and learn the material.

## Blender.org
If you don't already have blender you can go to the official website and download it.
You can run the installer or use it as a portable application.

## Addons

The number one addon I use is Machin3tools. I never use blender without it these days. Luckily it's free and makes the workflow a little faster. My main use for this addon are the fast pie menus which make switching contexts much more fluid.

### Store
One hub for getting blender addons is the blender market. Part of the profits made there are donated to the blender foundation. However legally any addons are supposed to be free and opensource so most can be found on GitHub.

# Paid Resources
Although there are a lot of great free resources, there are a lot of excellent paid sources as well.


## Blender Cloud
The first paid resource I'm going to recommend is blender cloud. Because the money goes to support blender development, and the trainings and resources are straight from blender itself.
