1. Watch the videos in the *how to complete* section below
2. create 3 unique materials per shaderball
3. Render 9 images, 3 per shaderball
4. Test 3 different HDRI enviornments for each render

## Important Workflows!

>[!IMPORTANT] These are things that I mention in my video. WATCH THE VIDEO!

### Link Data
You can copy data to many other objects. In this assignment you will likely want to copy material assignments.
1. Select multiple objects. 
	1. Notice the difference in the outline colors. A lighter outline indicates the active selection. This is object you are going to copy *from*
2. Press cntrl+L -> a menu will pop up
3. Click on *Link Materials*

### Select all Objects in Collection
Collections are not groups. For that reason they may work a little different than expected. In order to quickly select everything in a collection do the following:
1. In your outliner find the collection where you want to select all of the objects.
2. Right click on that collection
3. Select *Select Objects*

### Recursively Toggle View in Collection
Again, collections are not groups and the default behavior is not recursive. There is an easy fix though.

>[!IMPORTANT] In this assignment you MUST do this or you will not be able to complete it correctly!

In order to toggle *Render Visibility* in all children of an object or collection hold down *SHIFT* and click on the render icon in the outliner.
This works for the other toggles in the outliner as well.

### Node Wrangler
You should have the *Node Wrangler*  addon enabled. This can really help with node based workflows in Blender. 
Go to *edit* / *preferences* / *addons* and find *Node Wrangler* and enable it.

### Rendering and Saving Images
In order to do a final render you need to press *F12* or navigate to the *Render* menu and click *Render Image*


### View Through Camera
To see what your camera sees in the viewport you need to click *0* on your numpad or the little camera button under the compass in the upper right of the 3D Viewport.
