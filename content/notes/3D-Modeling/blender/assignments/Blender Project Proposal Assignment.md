This assignment is a proposal for your final project in 3D.

What to turn in:
- A PDF file 
- An OBS screen recording showing your proposal and talking through it

>[!WARNING] To turn in the OBS recording you must upload it to youtube or vimeo (you can set videos to be unlisted) and paste the link. If you upload a physical video file you will get a zero until you fix it.

>[!IMPORTANT] If you don't know how to setup OBS watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sh98cXPsTM) video.

What I expect:
- A PDF file containing the following:
	- A description of what you would like to accomplish.
	- Some concept art or sketches of what you might want to accomplish.
	- Some reference images or a mood board type images.
	- A description of your art direction for the final piece
		- How you will integrate it into a scene
			- That could be a screenshot from a film
			- Your own art.
			- Or something else.
			- REMEMBER -> we are not just modeling, we taking a model from start to finish which includes shading and rendering and compositing into a single image.
	- A rough timeline of when you will complete the different steps. These could include:
		- Whitebox modeling.
		- Final Modeling
		- Surfacing shading
		- rendering
		- compositing
	- Your personal goals for this project, what you want to learn and how this will help you learn it.
