Outline:
- What is houdini?
	- UNIX
		- POSIX file system
		- terminal within houdini
		- shell commands
		- paths
	- nodes
		- just like in unix, everything is a "file" and thus everything has a path
		- paths are *UNIX* paths -> /context/node/parm/etc
			- paths can also be relative -> ../../node/parm/etc
		- 
	- proceduralism
		- concept
			- build systems to generate results you want
			- more upfront work but easier to change down the road
				- Good padding for changing things, much faster if you've build the system well
	- LINUX
		- Linux is the VFX standard platform
		- Houdini works best on Linux
			- it is a unix based micro OS after all
		- Pipelines work best on Linux
			- POSIX paths and file systems and the terminal tools are just superior on linux
		- tools work best on Linux
