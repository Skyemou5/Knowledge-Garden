Because houdinis underlying architecture is procedural and node-based, creating systems for anything that follow that model is fairly straightforward as long as you understand how things work.

Houdini excels in these approaches for the following reasons:

-   Node-based approach: Create models using interconnected nodes.
-   Geometry nodes: Perform modeling operations and attribute manipulation.
-   Procedural relationships: Establish dynamic connections between nodes.
-   Procedural generation: Generate variations using randomness and algorithms.
-   Iterative refinement: Quickly iterate and modify models.
-   Digital assets: Reusable components encapsulating procedural models.
