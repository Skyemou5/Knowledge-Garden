Self Study is a critical skill, especially in computer science, technical art, and artistic fields.

In fact I would go so far as to say if you have a hard time learning on your own you either need to get to a point where it's natural or you may want to consider perusing a different field.

On a lighter note, it is possible to learn. The difficulty comes because most of us are trained to follow instructions and do what we are told. When you are suddenly expected to be self-motivated and do projects on your own it's going to be hard and you may feel discouraged and give up. Don't give up yet.

One of the best short explanations that I've found recently is a video from *Corridor* on how to self-study. Watch that first before moving forward.
