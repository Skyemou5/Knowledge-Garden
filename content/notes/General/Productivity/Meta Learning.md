Meta learning is the process of learning how to learn, or developing strategies and techniques that can help individuals learn more effectively. This can include understanding how the brain processes information, identifying effective methods for information retention and recall, and developing problem-solving skills.

Some examples of meta learning techniques that can be used by humans include:

1.  Spaced repetition: This is a method of memorization that involves reviewing information at increasing intervals over time.
2.  Active recall: This is a method of testing oneself on the material being learned to actively retrieve the information from memory.
3.  Elaborative encoding: This is a method of connecting new information to existing knowledge and making connections between new information.
4.  Self-explanation: This is a method of explaining to oneself how a new concept or idea fits into what one already knows.
5.  Interleaving: This is a method of switching between different tasks or topics, which can help build connections between different pieces of information.
6.  Deliberate practice: This is method of focusing on specific aspects of a task or skill, and breaking it down into smaller parts to make it manageable.
7.  Chunking: This is method of breaking down information into smaller and more manageable pieces for easier recall.
8.  Reflection: This is the method of looking back on one's learning experience, evaluating and assessing the effectiveness of one's own learning strategies.

It's also important to learn to pick out the most important information. For instance in language learning, you can become conversationally proficient if you focus (at first) on only the grammar and vocab that has the highest frequency of use. You could spend your whole life learning a language. Order of operations is important.

Important points:
- be deliberate with your learning
- Do it in stages
	1. First time through just listen or watch
	2. Second time through follow along
	3. Third time through record what you learned
