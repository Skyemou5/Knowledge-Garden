# Lesson Plan

-   Importance of project management for animation students
-   What is a pipeline?
-   Importance of project conventions.
-   Style Guides for project management
-   File formats
-   Version control and backups
-   Communication and working in a team


Production Phases of a typical project

1.  Pre-production: This phase includes tasks such as concept development, script writing, storyboarding, and character design. All the necessary information and assets should be gathered, and a production schedule should be created.
2.  Production: During this phase, the actual animation is created. This includes tasks such as modeling, texturing, rigging, and animation.
3.  Post-production: In this phase, the final animation is polished and prepared for delivery. This includes tasks such as compositing, color correction, sound design, and editing.
4.  Final Delivery: The final animation is delivered to the client or uploaded to a distribution platform.
5.  Archive: All the assets and files are properly stored, backed up and archived.

# Conventions:

1.  File Naming: Use descriptive, meaningful and consistent names for all files and folders. Use version numbers, date and initials in the file names. Avoid using spaces or special characters in file names.
2.  Folder Structure: Have a clear and consistent folder structure that separates different types of assets, such as character models, textures, and animations. Within each asset folder, have a clear organization for different stages of the asset, such as concept art, modeling, rigging, etc.
3.  Version control: Use a version control system such as Git to keep track of changes to the project files over time. This allows for easy collaboration, and the ability to revert to previous versions of the project if necessary.
4.  Backup: Regularly backup all project files to an external drive or cloud storage. This ensures that the project files are safe in case of a local drive failure or other issues.
5.  File Formats: Use industry standard file formats for all assets, such as PNG or JPG for textures, FBX or OBJ for models, and MP4 or AVI for animations.
6.  File organization: Organize files by type, date and version. This will help to find the right file quickly and easily.
7.  File resolutions: use appropriate resolution for each type of asset, for example high resolution for final renders, lower resolution for concept art and tests.
8.  File compression: Use appropriate compression for each type of file, for example lossless for final renders and lossy for concept art and tests.


# Example Style-guide for a Project

1.  File Naming:
	-   Use all lowercase letters
	-   Use hyphens or underscores instead of spaces
	-   Use a consistent naming convention, such as "projectname_sequence_shot_version"
	-   Include version numbers in the file name`
2.  File Organization:
	-   Create a clear and consistent folder structure for the project
	-   Use folders for different elements, such as characters, environments, and assets
	-   Use subfolders for different stages of the project, such as concept art, modeling, animation, and compositing
3.  File Formats:
	-   Use open, non-proprietary file formats whenever possible
	-   Use lossless file formats for all source files
	-   Use compressed file formats for final delivery
4.  Color Management:
	-   Use a consistent color space and bit depth throughout the project
	-   Use color charts and color swatches to maintain consistency
	-   Use color management tools to ensure consistency across different platforms
5.  Version Control:
	-   Use a version control system, such as Git, to track changes and collaborate with others
	-   Use branches and merge requests to manage different versions of the project
6.  Communication and Collaboration:
	-   Use a project management tool, such as Asana or Trello, to keep track of tasks and deadlines
	-   Use a chat or video conferencing tool, such as Slack or Zoom, to communicate with team members
	-   Use a shared drive, such as Google Drive or Dropbox, to share files and collaborate on documents


# Coding Style-Guide

A style guide for coding outlines the conventions that should be followed when writing code for a particular project. It can cover things such as naming conventions, indentation, commenting, and more. Here's an example of what a style guide for coding might include:

1.  Naming Conventions:
	-   Use clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes
	-   Use camelCase for variables and functions, and PascalCase for classes
	-   Use consistent prefixes or suffixes to indicate the type of a variable, such as "is", "has", "should"
2.  Indentation and Spacing:
	-   Use consistent indentation levels for code blocks
	-   Use spaces around operators and after commas
	-   Use blank lines to separate logical sections of code
3.  Comments:
	-   Include comments for complex or non-obvious code
	-   Use clear and concise language in comments
	-   Use inline comments to explain the purpose of a specific line of code
4.  Functions and Methods:
	-   Limit the number of lines in a function to a maximum of 25-30 lines
	-   Avoid using global variables and functions
	-   Use the single responsibility principle, where a function should have only one purpose
5.  Error Handling:
	-   Use try-catch blocks to handle errors
	-   Use clear and descriptive error messages
	-   Avoid using exceptions for flow control
6.  Code Reviews:
	-   Use code reviews to ensure that the code meets the style guide's requirements
	-   Use code reviews to catch bugs and improve the quality of the code
	-   Use code reviews to share knowledge among team members

This is a general example of a style guide for coding, and it can be adjusted to the specific needs of the project, the programming language, and the team. The goal is to have a clear

# Some Team Workflows

Here are some specific ways teams work on animated projects:

1.  Reviews:
	-   Team members typically present their work to the supervisor for review at various stages of production, such as concept art, storyboarding, animation, and compositing.
	-   During the review, the supervisor provides feedback and makes suggestions for improvements.
	-   Review meetings are usually scheduled at regular intervals, such as weekly or bi-weekly, to ensure that the project stays on track and that any issues are addressed in a timely manner.
2.  Planning:
	-   Teams typically use project management tools, such as Asana or Trello, to plan and track the progress of the project.
	-   The team lead or supervisor creates a schedule for the project and breaks it down into smaller tasks that are assigned to individual team members.
	-   Tasks are usually organized by department, such as modeling, animation, and compositing, and are assigned a due date and a priority level.
3.  Iterations:
	-   Teams typically work in iterations where they complete a set of tasks, review the work, and make changes as needed.
	-   Iterations are usually timed, such as one or two weeks, and are used to ensure that the project stays on schedule and that the team is making progress.
	-  After each iteration, the team reviews the progress and makes adjustments to the schedule as needed.
4.  Collaboration:
	-   Team members typically use collaboration tools, such as Slack or Zoom, to communicate with each other and share information.
	-   They use cloud-based storage, such as Google Drive or Dropbox, to share files and collaborate on documents.
	-   They may use version control system such as git to collaborate on code, documents and assets.
5.  Finalization:
	-   Once the animation is done, the final stages are color-grading, sound-editing and final compositing.
	-   The final animation is then delivered to the client or broadcasted.

These are some common ways that teams work on animated projects, but the workflow can vary depending on the size and scope of the project, the tools and resources available, and the preferences of the team.
