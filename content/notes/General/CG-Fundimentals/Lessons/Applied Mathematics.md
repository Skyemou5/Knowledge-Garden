In CG, no matter what you're focus is there are mathematics. Depending on your career path you may or may not need to dive deeply into the math used, however even if you think you wont having even just a rudimentary understanding will give you an edge in many ways.
For example, without a general understanding of what normals are and even an eagles eye view of linear algebra it may be hard to diagnose and fix problems with the surfaces of 3D model.
If you are rigging it might be very difficult to fix and build complex rigs without a good understanding of linear algebra. This is because rigging is all about coordinate spaces and transformations.
