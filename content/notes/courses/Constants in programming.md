In programming, a constant is a named value that has a fixed value and cannot be changed during the execution of a program. Constants are typically used to represent values that don't change, such as mathematical constants, physical constants, or other values that should remain unchanged during the execution of the program.

The use of constants allows developers to improve the readability and maintainability of their code. For example, instead of hardcoding a value throughout the code, a constant can be used and defined in a single place, making it easier to update the value if needed.

In most programming languages, constants are declared with a specific keyword or syntax, such as `const` in JavaScript, `final` in Java, or `#define` in C/C++. The actual syntax for declaring constants varies from language to language, but the basic concept of using constants remains the same across many programming languages.
