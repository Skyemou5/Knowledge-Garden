## Knowledge Management and Learning

Before I get into programming, let's talk about learning, and knowledge management.

[How to Learn ANYTHING - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brffDCE5hXs)

Important points:
- be deliberate with your learning
- Do it in stages
	1. First time through just listen or watch
	2. Second time through follow along
	3. Third time through record what you learned

Knowledge management is a personal system you develop in order to record and recall the information you need to.

There are many systems out there but you will have to create your own.

Often people end up creating what they call second brains in conjunction with their knowledge management systems. Below are some popular tools for the task:

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) -> My personal favorite
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)
- [Evernote](https://evernote.com/)
- [Coda](https://coda.io/)
- [Logseq: A privacy-first, open-source knowledge base](https://logseq.com/)
- [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/)
- [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/)
- [Org-roam](https://www.orgroam.com/)

Some related tools that are often used in conjunction with obsidian and should be noted:

[[Git Hub |Version Control Notes]]

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)
- [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)

In this course I highly suggest you start creating your own personal knowledge managment system.

My suggestion is to start with Obsidian and either set it up with *git* or *google drive* or something similar.

>[!NOTE] I may want some homework turned in with github at some point, if so, you could put your vaults in a git repo, don't worry we'll cover that too.

### How To Use Obsidian

Obsidian uses [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and formats your text accordingly. One you learn it it's much faster than using traditional document editors because you do all the formatting in the same line, no need to click buttons and select text.

We are going to learn some of the fundimentals of programming. My goal is to teach you the fundimentals so you can understand the basics of any programming language you encounter.



To do so, I will cover the following things. 

- History of computing
- How computers work
- What are programming languages
- How do programming languages work
- What is javascript
