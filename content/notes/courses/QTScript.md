QtScript is a scripting engine that was used in the Qt software development framework. It provides an environment for writing and executing JavaScript code, and it integrates with the rest of the Qt framework.

QtScript was designed to make it easy to add scripting capabilities to Qt-based applications, and it provided a bridge between the C++ and JavaScript worlds. With QtScript, developers could use JavaScript to implement custom behavior, create dynamic user interfaces, and interact with the underlying C++ code in their application.

QtScript was part of the Qt framework from version 4.3 until version 5.6, but it was replaced with the more modern QtQml module in later versions of the framework. The QtQml module provides a JavaScript environment for writing QML, a declarative language for creating user interfaces and animations.
