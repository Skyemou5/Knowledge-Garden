# Course Title: Project Management, JavaScript for ToonBoom, and 3D for 2D Pipelines using Blender Duration: 4 Months

## Introduction:

-   Overview of course goals and objectives
-   Introduction to project management, JavaScript for ToonBoom, and 3D for 2D pipelines using Blender

## Module 1: Project Management

-   Fundamentals of project management
-   Knowledge Management
-   Version control
-   Planning and scheduling of projects
-   Resource allocation and management
-   Project execution and monitoring

-   Introduction to Blender and its interface
-   3D modeling and animation basics
-   Texturing, lighting and rendering in Blender
-   Integration of Blender with 2D pipelines
-   Integration of 3D into ToonBoom
-   Post prodcution
-   More - if we get to it

## Assessment:

-   Assignments to apply concepts learned
-   Final project to demonstrate mastery of course content

### Final Project

The final project will be creating a 3D scene according to your skill level.

The goal of this project is to take you through the entire pipeline of film and animation, even if that's a small slice, from modeling to surfacing, to ligthing, and a final rendered image with post-production.

The final will (most likely) be 100 pts.

## Late Policy:

-   Late submissions will result in a 10% reduction in assignment marks, up to a maximum of 50%.
