# Idiomatic Rust

Using rust properly, and with the correct grammer.

Rust has built in tools to help with this

rustfmt

cargo rustfmt

this will help with white space and stuff. This is basically the rust styleguide.

wont check for compiles

configure IDE to use rustfmt on save.

> If you want to change how rustfmt works you can put a .rustfmt.toml at the root of your project
