## Character type

char

could be anything from sound, icon, action, letters.

char consists of 4 bytes.
typically makes characters UCS-4/UTF-32 types

character literals are specified using single quotes
```rust
let letter ='a';
```

*characters are mostly useless, use strings instead*


>Strings DO NOT use chars in them as they are UTF-8
