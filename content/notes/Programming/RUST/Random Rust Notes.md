converting a string to number

variable are immutable by default, to change them later you have to set it to be mutable
- this is for safety and concurrency and speed

constants

`const CAPITAL_CASE: i32 = 9.0;`

declare capital type assignment

these can be global
these are even faster than immutable vars
