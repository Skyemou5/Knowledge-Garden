# Libraries and modules

the main library is lib.rs inside that if you declare a module via pub mod mymodule; (ended in semicolon) then rust will look for rs file in the same directory as the name of the module. Nested modules use directories

create executable binary for the library
 place file in bin/ of src/ like bar.rs or something
