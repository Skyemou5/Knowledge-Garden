Git is the standard *version control* solution for a majority of digital projects.

Git is first and foremost a *command-line tool* or *CLI*. This means that it runs in whatever text-based interface your OS uses. Typically:



| OS      | Terminal                      |
| ------- | ----------------------------- |
| Linux   | bash                          |
| Mac     | ZSH                           |
| Windows | command prompt and powershell |
