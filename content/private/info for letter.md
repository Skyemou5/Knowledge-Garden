I didn't have words for it for a very long time. I had a bit of a disconnect for most of my life. I think I knew something was wrong very early. around 8 I would see girls in church and my sisters doing things I would be explicitly discluded and it would feel really bad. Very early around the age of 10, I remember feeling like my body was wrong, I started having dysphmorphia and on top of the dysphoria that I didn't really understand or recognize. Something felt wrong, I thought it was my weight, but really it was puberty starting, and all the new things were all wrong. I ended up normalizing how much I hated my body and generally existing as a man. I wished I was never born, most days in my youth. This was all compounded by growing up in an extremely controlling religion with emotionally abusive parents. I frequently would see myself in the mirror and have to hold back tears. I started shaving a lot of body hair around the age of 12, especially chest hair. I had dreams of being a woman and having the right body and would wake up and cry. I wished I didn't have a penis, I would daydream about what it would be like if I had female genitals. I wished I could wear girl clothes. I would put wigs on and feel happy. I wanted long hair, but was told I shouldn't or that it would look bad on me. I still am very distressed about many things that my body became after going through male puberty, a lot of my facial bone structure is distressing, facial and body hair is distressing, male pattern fat is distressing. 
I have been living as my correct gender for about a year.
I have had therapy for many years. But therapy for gender related things started around october of 2022. I started estradiol in november, several months later I started progesterone. I've been on both for a little over a year.
I have researched quite a bit about surgeries. My partner has had FFS recently and I feel pretty educated about the whole process.
My partner will be my primary caretaker. I have a safe space to recover in where I will be taken care of.

Generally, I feel like correcting some of the more masculine features in my face would make it easier for me to be seen as a woman and would greatly reduce dysphoria, depression and anxiety. And I would be generally much happier.
