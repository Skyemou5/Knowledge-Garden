Subject: Personal Matter and Workplace Transition

Dear Kim

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to you about a personal matter that is important to me and that will also have an impact on my professional life. As you know, I have been with UVU for five years, and during this time, I have deeply valued our working relationship and the supportive environment we share.

I wanted to share with you that I am transgender. Over a year ago, I began hormone replacement therapy as part of my gender transition, and I have been gradually coming out to my friends, family, and close colleagues. I am now ready to fully embrace my authentic self in all aspects of my life, including at work.

I understand that this may come as a surprise, and I am happy to discuss any questions or concerns you might have. My hope is to make this transition as smooth as possible for everyone involved. I am currently in the process of updating my name and gender in various personal and professional contexts, and I would appreciate your support in making these updates at UVU as well.

My commitment to my role and responsibilities remains unchanged, and I am eager to continue contributing to our team's success. I also hope that my transition can be an opportunity for our team to grow in our understanding and support for diversity and inclusion.

I am in contact with the People and Culture Department to ensure that all necessary procedures are followed, and I am seeking their guidance on the best ways to communicate this change to the rest of the team.

Thank you for taking the time to read this email. I appreciate your understanding and support during this significant time in my life. Please let me know when would be a convenient time for us to have a conversation, should you wish to discuss this further.

Sincerely, [Your Name]
