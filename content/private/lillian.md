also... for some reason I have a really hard time initiating talking about things I want or feel like I need out loud especially if it's related to physical touch. so... idk... maybe I can just text? It's not my favorite... I know it's not yours either. Also we are not good at getting back to things. so hopefully we can. Anyway... yeah... so I've been holding in for so many months distress around physical intimacy. I've been trying to work through why it's so hard with my therapist. But basically, lots of RSD of course, but also so much trauma about talking about my wants and needs and physical intimacy and sex. It was always bad and dangerous, at an early age, you know this. So anytime I want to be touched more, or am feeling like sexual I feel fight or flight when I try and speak about it, especially with you for some reason. And I really don't want that. It's very frustrating for me. Then it swirls around in my head, and we spiral and spiral and it gets harder to talk about. I easily blame myself and feel defective and sad. I'm just saying this, because I want you to understand. I am NOT implying any of this is you're fault. I have a serious communication problem, and I am trying to correct it and work on it. 
I've been really sad for a while about lack of physical intimacy and sex. The last time was probably 8 month ago, and then you changed your mind. well there was that other time you use your hands on me. But really that's been it. I know you've said it's not really on your mind a lot, and also you are pretty asexual, and I get that, and I've been really trying to meet you there. Over the last many months I've tried to express how I felt several times... but kind of felt a little unheard. But also I'm so afraid of making you feel pressured into things. And I'm also worried you don't want to engage because of your sensory things and don't want my RSD to flare up, which is totally understandable, I know it's a lot, I'm sorry. I think sometimes I just feel worried, that you aren't attracted to me physically, which if it's true, that's ok, and I'll try and stop thinking about it or hoping. I frequently feel like I initiate a lot of touch, that's a bit more than platonic, I like to feel all your curves, and skin, and want you to feel beautiful, loved, appreciated, and attractive, because I love you so much and am physically attracted to you as well, so it's easy for me. It's kind of hard to explain... but I feel really sad, when I do that for you, and don't get much physical touch in return, or that touch feels much more platonic. Part of my mind has been trying to figure out what's wrong with me, what do I need to change to get you to touch me more, and more intimately. Obviously a big part of that problem is my terrible communication skills in that department, and I'm not trying to play a blame game at all.
I think when I finally had sex with kyra, it was just so relieving because it's something I really feel I need much more and want to explore more in general. But also it's important to me with people I love, and I love you SO MUCH, so of course I want to do those things more with you. I think it's been hard to talk about, because all of these emotions have been swirling, and when we do, I just want to cry because I'm sad about not having it much with you, and when you do show some physical intimacy I want to cry because I am just so happy and relieved that you still want that with me at least a little. I think I mentioned before, that one way I was coping was just trying to give up, that you were ever going to want to be intimate again with me. (I know, not healthy, and yeah, working on it). So then we all had sex with Kyra and Nora, I was surprised you felt sexual and wanted to participate. And wanted to cry the whole time because I didn't think it was going to happen between us again. And then the added element, of my dumb brain swirling negative things like: "why now, with someone else, not over the past 8 months or so between just us?" "what's wrong with me?". But I was so relieved, and overjoyed to have that experience with you again, and just in general with Kyra and nora, it was really fun for me and special, and I long for more sexual experiences in general.
I think I would feel more secure and somewhat relieved if more intimate touch were initiated by you, and if it lasted longer too. That and I don't notice many times you telling me that I am pretty, or attractive. Again, I don't want you to feel like you need to do these things, It might just not be "you", which I'm ok accepting. I want to feel attractive to you, wanted. Also I don't need sensual touch to turn into sex. If you are worried about that. I think if I get better at being open about all this with you we can get better at talking and communicating about intimacy and sex. I think just feeling like things are less platonic would be nice. I would also really like to kiss you more, but I know there's lots of sensory issues there, I get it. I also like being kissed all over, wet kisses, bites, licks, etc. 
Even as I write this I feel very guilty and stupid, and I feel like it shouldn't be such a big deal to me. And I am mortally terrified that this will make you stressed and feel bad. I just need to get this all out, it's been tearing me apart not being able to verbalize it, or verbalize it well. And this is a big reason my therapist suggested you join us sometime, to have a place to chat that might be easier. Crow has been helping me push forward and write this.
I want you to know, I love you SO GODDAMN MUCH it hurts sometimes. You are my favorite person in the whole world, and I feel so lucky to be in your life, and you make my life better, and I am excited for the years to come. You are so special to me, and such a beautiful, loving, silly, woman. I want to get better at talking, and normalize things, make it easier. But I need your help to work through some of it. I love you so much.

Also... for some reason, it's super hard for me to start conversations about stuff I want or need, especially if it's about physical touch. So... idk, maybe texting could work? It's not ideal for either of us, but it's something, right? We're also not the best at revisiting topics, so here's hoping we can improve on that. Anyway, I've been quietly struggling with our physical intimacy for months. I've been unpacking why it's so difficult with my therapist. A lot has to do with RSD, but there's also a ton of trauma around expressing my wants and needs about physical intimacy and sex, from bad experiences when I was younger. You're aware of this. So, when I crave more touch or feel sexual, I hit this wall of fight or flight, especially when trying to talk to you, which is frustrating. Then these thoughts just spin in my head, and we end up spiraling, making it even tougher to discuss. I tend to blame myself, feeling broken and sad. I'm sharing this to help you understand, not to imply it's your fault. I know I have a big issue with communicating about this, and I'm working on it.

I've been feeling pretty down about our lack of physical intimacy and sex. The last significant time was about 8 months ago, plus that other time with your hands. That's pretty much it. I understand that sex isn't a big thing for you, and you lean asexual, which I totally respect. I've tried to express how I feel several times over the past few months, but I sometimes felt a bit unheard. I'm also scared of pressuring you. I worry you might avoid getting physical because of your sensory issues or to avoid triggering my RSD, which I completely understand. Sometimes I fear you're not physically attracted to me, which, if true, is okay—I'll try to adjust my expectations. I often initiate touch that goes beyond platonic because I want you to feel beautiful, loved, appreciated, and attractive, as that's how I see you. It's hard when the physical touch I get in return feels more platonic. I keep questioning what I need to change to get more intimate touch from you. Clearly, my lack of skill in communicating about this is a big part of the issue, and I'm not trying to blame anyone.

The experience with Kyra was a relief because I deeply need and want that kind of connection, especially with those I love—and I love you immensely. That's why I desire it with you too. It's been tough to bring up because of all the swirling emotions, and when we do talk, I'm on the verge of tears, whether from sadness or relief. I had started to resign myself to the idea that you might not want to be intimate with me again (which I know isn't healthy, and I'm addressing it). So, the intimacy with Kyra and Nora took me by surprise—I didn't expect you to participate, and it brought up a mix of confusion and relief. But I was also really happy to share that experience with you and them.

I think I'd feel more secure and somewhat relieved if you initiated more intimate touch and if it lasted longer. Also, I don't often hear you say I'm pretty or attractive, which affects how I feel about myself in our relationship. I want to feel desired and attractive to you. And just to be clear, not all sensual touch has to lead to sex—I'm okay with that. If I can get better at expressing all this, perhaps we can improve our discussions about intimacy and sex. I'd love more affectionate touch, more kisses, but I'm mindful of the sensory issues—I get it. I enjoy being kissed, wet kisses, bites, licks, all that.

Writing this feels awkward and I'm worried it might stress you out, which is the last thing I want. But I needed to get it off my chest. It's been tough keeping it inside. My therapist suggested you might join a session, to help us talk about this in a potentially easier setting. Crow's been a big support in encouraging me to write this down.

I need you to know, I love you incredibly, more than words can say. You're my favorite person, and I'm so grateful for you. You make my life brighter, and I'm excited about our future together. You're an amazing, beautiful, loving, and fun person. I'm eager to improve our communication, normalize these conversations, and make things easier. But I need your help with some of it. I love you so much.
