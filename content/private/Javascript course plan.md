This semester I'm going to cover several things.
After talking with rodayne

- fundimentals of scripting
	- javascript
- 3D fundimentals
	- Blender
	- grease pencil
	- creating an asset from scratch


these students are in the 2D program and will have to taught why some of this technical stuff is still valuable for them even as artists.

- 3D elements are often in 2D productions
- Solving technical problems even as an artist makes you more valuable
