I've been deeply hurt by someone I've known all my life – my cousin. They chose tag my new account using my old name, which outed me to everyone. It was a clear case of misgendering, and it's left me reeling because it was done on purpose. 

It's especially tough because I remember all the summers we spent together as kids. Never did I think those memories would be overshadowed by such a hurtful act. It's clear that the path they've gone down, with all the conspiracy stuff, has changed things between us.

I've always believed in keeping doors open, but I also believe in self-respect. So, here's where I stand: if they're willing to make amends and show some real understanding, I'm here. But until then, I need to keep my distance for my own peace of mind. I will cut anyone else off family or not, that is hurtful in this way, for my own mental health and well being, even though it's hard, and l still love all of my family.

This isn't a call to action against them. Please, let's keep things respectful. It's just me laying out my side and how I plan to handle things. I'm sad, I won't lie – it's tough realizing some family might see things their way. But I'm also hopeful that understanding and love can still find a way through.

Family is more than just blood; it's the bonds we choose to maintain and the respect we give and get. That's my piece. Thanks for hearing me out, and thanks to everyone who's shown me their true colors in the best way possible.
