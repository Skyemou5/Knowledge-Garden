# About This Site
This website was created in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) editor focused around knowledge management. This website contains a knowledge graph similar to what Obsidian uses in order to help you navigate and find the resources you need.

This is mostly for me to share my knowledge with anyone who wants to learn the same things I have learned.


## How to use this website
To easily use this website do a few things:
1. Click through the relevant links.
2. Click through the knowledge graph at the bottom of each page.
3. Use the search bar.
4. Click on tags to see all notes with the same tag.


## Courses
This website contains resources and helpful information for anyone taking DGM 2210 and 1610 at UVU. You don't need to be part of those classes to find this helpful though.
